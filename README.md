# Digestive Disaster TD

Digestive Disaster is a game set in at Queen's University's Leonard Hall. The food in the dining hall has gone so bad that they've became walking monsters. Your goal as the player is to strategically place figher students to ensure that no food damages students or escapes the dining hall.

- The game spawns students that will not fight, these are called "vacuous students"
- You have a total of 8 fighter students to choose from to place on tables
- Certain students can deal "purify damage", when a food is purified, it can be fed to students to increase health, range, attack speed, and damage
- Boss enemies will spawn at times, they will make their way to the exit without targeting students
- You lose the game if any food exits the dining hall, or if too many students die
